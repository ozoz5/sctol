          <p>You’re not still manually renaming Apple receipt screenshots, are you?</p>
          <p>Yeah, I was.</p>
          <p>I’d take a screenshot, read the date and amount with my eyes, and peck the filename in manually.</p>
          <p>I’m one of those Japanese people who did that tax-season grind over and over, and got fed up enough to build this thing.</p>
          <p>Normally, you just paste images and move on. Who cares about filenames, right?</p>
          <p>Then later, your receipts go missing, and you waste time you could’ve spent on something better.</p>

        <section class="guide-block" id="why-sctol">
          <h2>That’s why I built “SCTOL”</h2>
          <p>Then one day, even this idiot realized something: I wanted filenames to change automatically. That’s all.</p>
          <p>So I built this thing solo. That’s “SCTOL.”</p>
          <p>If you throw screenshot images (PDFs kind of work too) onto the screen, it reads date, amount, and service name automatically, then generates save-ready filenames. Images are processed in your browser only, so they don’t go anywhere.</p>
          <p>OCR reads text -> picks date, amount, and service name -> generates filename. Then you tweak a few fields on the right and you’re done. Ten minutes of manual typing becomes three seconds.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="guide-block" id="not-perfect">
          <h2>It’s not perfect (honestly)</h2>
          <p>It’s not perfect. Honestly.</p>
          <p>If it’s an Apple standard-format screenshot, text isn’t crushed, and the whole thing is visible, it usually reads fine. Recompressed blurry images, cropped captures, and non-Apple formats are rough. You’ll also occasionally get date misreads, amount digit slips, or service-name mix-ups. Don’t overtrust OCR. Always verify against the original. Built by an idiot, not a genius.</p>
          <p>If you’re one of the wise people who knows a better way, I’d be grateful if you send me a note through the contact page.</p>

        <section class="guide-block" id="disclaimer">
          <h2>Quick disclaimer</h2>
          <p>Quick disclaimer too.</p>
          <p>This tool has nothing to do with Apple. It is not provided, certified, or guaranteed by Apple, and extraction accuracy is not guaranteed. Always make final decisions against the original.</p>
          <p>And yes, I’d love people at Apple to use it too.</p>
