          <h2>Everyone gets stuck in the same place</h2>
          <p>Wait... was there really no better way?</p>
          <p>At the root of this mess: Apple doesn’t let you download receipts as PDFs. They just casually send them by email.</p>
          <p>So you end up taking screenshots and managing them yourself, and either way you still need filenames or future-you will absolutely lose it.</p>
          <p>I thought, “It’s 2026, surely this already exists.” It didn’t.</p>
          <p>What exists out there is “tools that read text from screenshots” and “accounting software that books expenses.” The gap in the middle, “just give me clean filenames fast,” was weirdly empty.</p>
          <p>Sure, Hazel can automate stuff on Mac, but setup is heavy, it’s Mac-only, and I didn’t want that much ceremony. Even in Apple communities, people keep asking “How do I download receipt PDFs?” and it ends with “just screenshot the damn email!”</p>
          <p>Everyone gets stuck in the same place.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="guide-block" id="need-sctol">
          <h2>So I wanted it. That’s SCTOL.</h2>
          <p>Then when you take screenshots on Mac, filenames come out like “Screenshot 2026-02-26 19.00.00”... I KNOW.</p>
          <p>That’s not a title, that’s your diary entry!</p>
          <p>I just wanted it to exist. That’s SCTOL.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="guide-block" id="three-patterns">
          <h2>Three ways to organize screenshot receipts</h2>
          <p>There are honestly only three patterns.</p>
          <h3 id="pattern-manual">1) Manual typing (what I used to do)</h3>
          <p>Reliable. But once you pass around 10 files, your soul starts leaving your body. And even though you’re doing it yourself, your naming rule drifts. “Wait, date first? Amount first?” every single time.</p>
          <h3 id="pattern-generic-ocr">2) Generic OCR service + spreadsheet management</h3>
          <p>If you’re meticulous, this can work. But doing all that just for Apple receipts feels heavy. If you need to manage receipts from multiple vendors in one place, this route is usually better.</p>
          <h3 id="pattern-sctol">3) This tool</h3>
          <p>Because it’s specialized for Apple receipts, it’s the shortest path from drop-in to finalized filename. That’s it. And yes, it’s weaker for non-Apple stuff.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="guide-block" id="conclusion">
          <h2>TL;DR</h2>
          <p>If it’s only a few per month, manual is fine. If you have lots of non-Apple invoices too, use generic OCR. If Apple receipts pile up regularly, use this. You can also combine methods.</p>
          <p>But no matter what, verify amount and date with human eyes. If you go all-in hero mode and trust OCR 100% for your tax filing, that ending is on you.</p>
        </section>

          <h2>Final word</h2>
          <p>A truly flawless OCR does not exist in the world we live in...</p>
